/// A SwiftUI wrapper for ``VariableBlurView`` that provides a blur overlay whose intensity
/// gradually ramps from one edge to the other. This is useful for softly separating layers of
/// content (such as beneath the iOS status bar or above a toolbar) without hard border lines.
///
/// `VariableBlur` exposes the same configuration options as ``VariableBlurView`` through
/// chainable modifier methods, following standard SwiftUI conventions:
///
/// ```swift
/// VariableBlur(direction: .down)
///     .maximumBlurRadius(5)
///     .dimmingTintColor(.black)
///     .dimmingAlpha(.constant(alpha: 0.3))
/// ```
///
/// All default values match those of ``VariableBlurView``, so a plain `VariableBlur()` produces
/// the same result as a default `VariableBlurView`.
